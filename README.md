# drawer_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Scaffold
To add a drawer to the app, wrap it in a Scaffold widget. The Scaffold widget provides a consistent visual structure to apps that follow the Material Design Guidelines. It also supports special Material Design components, such as Drawers, AppBars, and SnackBars.

2. Add a drawer
Now add a drawer to the Scaffold. A drawer can be any widget, but itâ€™s often best to use the Drawer widget from the material library, which adheres to the Material Design spec.

3. Populate the drawer with items
Now that you have a Drawer in place, add content to it. For this example, use a ListView. While you could use a Column widget, ListView is handy because it allows users to scroll through the drawer if the content takes more space than the screen supports.

Populate the ListView with a DrawerHeader and two ListTile widgets. For more information on working with Lists, see the list recipes.
